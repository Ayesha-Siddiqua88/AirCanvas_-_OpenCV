# OpenCV and Air Canvas

This repo consists of a simple demostration of Air Canvas project that is built with OpenCV and mediapipe.<br>

### 🐍 Demo of OpenCV
▪ Reads and displays an RGB and grayscale flower image.<br>
▪ Applies a Gaussian blur to the image and displays both the original and blurred images.<br>
▪ The project reads an image, separates its color channels (blue, green, and red), and displays the original image along with individual blue, green, and red channels.<br>

### 🪄 Air Canvas
This project utilizes OpenCV and MediaPipe to enable hand tracking in a webcam feed. It allows users to draw on a canvas by moving their hand, with a "CLEAR" button to reset the canvas. Real-time hand landmarks are used to draw lines on both the video feed and a separate window representing the painted canvas.
